# Singly Linked List

## Overview

- A singly linked list is comprised of a series of nodes. Each node contains data and a link to the next node in the list.
- Since the nodes use links to denote the next node in the sequence, the nodes are not required to be sequentially stored in memory and allow for quick insertion and removal of nodes.
