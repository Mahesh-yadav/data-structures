# Singly Linked List

## Overview

- A singly linked list is comprised of a series of nodes. Each node contains data and a link to the next node in the list. The first node and the last node in the list are commonly called as head and tail of the list respectively.

- Since the nodes use links to denote the next node in the sequence, the nodes are not required to be sequentially located in memory. These links also allow for quick insertion and removal of nodes.

## Javascript Implementation

- Create a Node class to hold the data and links between nodes.

- Create a LinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes.
